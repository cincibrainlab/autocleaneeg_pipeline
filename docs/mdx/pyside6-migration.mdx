# Migrating to PySide6 for Cross-Platform Stability

<Steps>

### 1. Swap GUI Dependency

Replaced the PyQt5 requirement with **PySide6** in `pyproject.toml` so Linux builds no longer compile Qt from source.

### 2. Update Application Imports

`autoclean_review.py` now imports widgets from `PySide6` instead of `PyQt5`, removing the `pyqtRemoveInputHook` call.

### 3. Adjust Documentation Config

Reconfigured `docs/conf.py` to mock `PySide6` during doc builds.

### 4. Test the Installation

```bash
pip install .[gui]
pytest
```

</Steps>

If tests fail because optional dependencies are missing, install them individually before rerunning `pytest`.
