# ICA & Classification Updates

<Note>
These enhancements arrived after version 2.1.1 and will ship in the next release.
</Note>

## Smarter hybrid labeling
- Runs **ICLabel** on all components then reclassifies a subset with **ICVision**.
- Merges labels and per-class probabilities to keep a full `n_components Ã— 7` confidence matrix.
- Components reprocessed by ICVision are flagged with `annotator="ic_vision"` in the results.

## Clearer reports
- ICVision-reviewed components show a **[Vision]** tag in PDF summaries.
- Column widths in ICA tables were adjusted for better readability.

## API compatibility
- Calls to `mne_icalabel.label_components` no longer use the deprecated `verbose` argument.

<Tip>
Control how many components are rechecked with ICVision by passing `icvision_n_components` to `classify_ica_components`.
